In this project, we aimed to classify sickness using machine learning models. The first step in this process was preprocessing the data by cleaning it, dealing with null values, encoding categorical values, and addressing data imbalance. This was done to ensure that the data is suitable for use in machine learning models. Not only that, data cleaning is a crucial step to improve the accuracy of the models.

Next, we analysed the data, investigated the features, checked for correlation between the features, and examined the distribution of our data. This helped us to understand the data better and set the foundation for the models. We also detected any anomalies in our features and formed hypotheses about our experiment. This helped us to identify the features that are important to our problem and which features we can exclude from our models.

We then split the data into training and testing sets, and used the Random Forest, Adaboost, XGBoost, and Majority Voting models to classify the data. We chose these models because they are widely used in the literature and have proven to be effective in similar classification problems. We visualized the models to improve their accuracy and found the best hyperparameters. This helped us to understand the behavior of our models and improve their performance.

Finally, we concluded our models, model parameters, and model results. We also displayed the most important features used to solve the problem, providing insight into the factors that most strongly influence the classification of sickness. We also discussed the limitations of our work and provided suggestions for future work. Overall, the project demonstrates the potential of machine learning models for classifying sickness in healthcare settings and the importance of data preprocessing, feature selection and model evaluation for the success of the project.
